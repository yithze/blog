## Overview
This project is a comprehensive application designed for employee management, attendance tracking, and payroll management. Built as part of my final school assignment, it was developed in collaboration with AKA-Group to provide a robust and interactive solution tailored to their needs.

**Key Features:**
- Employee management with an interactive and dynamic input system for bonuses and deductions.
- Automatic salary calculations based on attendance records.
- Geolocation-based attendance (employees can only check-in within a 30-meter radius of the company).
- Separate interfaces for managers/admins and employees.


**Achievement:**
This project received the highest grade in the Final Year Project for the 9th batch of Software Engineering students at SMK Tunas Media,<span style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(to right, gold, orange)', WebkitBackgroundClip: 'text', color: 'transparent' }}> ranking 1st among all projects.</span>


## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js

## Features in Detail
### 1. Employee Management
The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee records, adding new employees, and updating their details.

### 2. Attendance Tracking
Attendance is managed dynamically with the following capabilities:
- Automatic marking of **Alpha** status for employees who are absent for more than 2 hours past their shift start time.
- Real-time attendance updates.

#### Code Snippet: Auto-Mark Alpha
The following code snippet demonstrates how the system automatically marks employees as **Alpha** if they are absent beyond the grace period of 2 hours. Unlike conventional attendance systems that store absent records directly into the database, this approach eliminates unnecessary database entries for non-attendance cases.

```javascript
if (!attendance) {
    const shiftStartTime = new Date(date);
    const [hours, minutes] = employee.shift.startTime.split(':');
    shiftStartTime.setHours(hours, minutes, 0, 0); // Set shift start time

    const gracePeriod = new Date(shiftStartTime);
    gracePeriod.setHours(gracePeriod.getHours() + 2); // Grace period of 2 hours

    if (today >= gracePeriod) {
        attendanceRecords.push({
            date: formattedDate,
            status: 'Alpha',  // Status Alpha if more than 2 hours
        });
    }
}
```

### 3. Payroll Management
The system integrates attendance data to automate salary calculations, incorporating interactive fields for:
- Bonus additions
- Multiple deductions for absences

## Developer Setup
During development, I utilized:
- **Neovim**: For efficient and customizable code editing.
- **LazyGit**: For seamless Git operations.

## Conclusion
This project not only provided a practical solution for AKA-Group but also served as an excellent learning experience. It strengthened my skills in MERN stack development, real-time data handling, and creating user-centric interfaces.
